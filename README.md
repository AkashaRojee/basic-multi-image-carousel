# Basic multi-image carousel built from scratch in JS

Original code (for single-image carousel) from [this article](https://medium.com/@marcusmichaels/how-to-build-a-carousel-from-scratch-in-vanilla-js-9a096d3b98c9).

Modified code to accomodate for multiple images, and simplified code to keep only the essential.

Notes:

<ul>
<li>No need to calculate old values of previous and next image in carousel because classes are reset.</li>
<li>To change the number of images displayed at any time in the carousel, change the value of the variable activeSlides in script.js. It should be greater than 1.</li>
<li>There should be a minimum of 3 images.
<li>The code is mainly to show the logic and the carousel isn't responsive. Width of images will have to be modified accordingly.</li>
</ul>
